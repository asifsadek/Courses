# Solutions of ODEs

# Index of Trajectories

Assumption __There is no fixed point on the trajectory C.__

The __Index__ of trajectory C ($I_C$) is equal to the number of fixed points
inside the trajectory. The sign is negative if trajectory is counter-clockwise.

## Dulac's criteria

$\exists g$ s.t. iff $\int_c g.x$ has same sign then $x$ is not periodic.

It follows from 'Green Theorem'.
