# Pendulum with non-linear equation

$$mL^2\ddot{\theta} + b \dot{\theta} + mgL sin(\theta) = \Gamma $${#eq:eq1}

Where b is drag, Î“ is external force applied to pendulum.

We make some substitutions given by @eq:eq2 to make @eq:eq1 dimentionless.

$$\alpha = \frac{b}{Lm\sqrt{gL}},\quad I = \frac{\Gamma}{mgL}, \quad
t=t'/\sqrt{g/L}$$ {#eq:eq2}



## Final system

$$\ddot{\theta} + sin(\theta) + \alpha\dot{\theta} = I$$ {#eq:eq3}

$$ \begin{gathered}
\dot{\theta} = \omega \\
\dot{\omega} = I - sin(\theta) - \alpha \omega
\end{gathered}
$$ {#eq:system}

# Results {#sec:result}

These plots are generated by much elaborate [python
model](http://github.com/dilawar/courses/raw/master/DynamicalSystems2018/HW1/pendulum_pyds.py).
This script uses `PyDSTool` and Python3. If you are using this library, please
use [my fork](https://github.com/dilawar/pydstool) which has been modified for
Python3 compatibility and tweaked for better plotting.

Following plots shows trajectories for various values of $I$ and $\alpha$. __The
color of trajectory shows the speed i.e. $\sqrt{d\theta^2+d\omega^2}$__. Near
fixed points, the trajectories get very slow.

# Discussion

The plots from @sec:result shows the oscillation may exists for small values of
$I$ and $\alpha$ and when both of them are close to each other.

Quick model in Maxima.
